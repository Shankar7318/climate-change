## predict climate trends and analyze the impact of climate change.
 ## Model Selection and Training 
 1. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): Neural network-based time-series forecasting.
 2. Linear Regression: Simple prediction model for temperature based on year and lag features.
 3. Random Forest: For more complex non-linear patterns.
    ### Model Optimization for Better Accuracy
   1.  Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV for models  like Random Forest to optimize parameters.
   2.  Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure model generalization.
   3.Ensemble Methods: Use ensemble learning techniques  Random Forest to enhance accuracy.

  ## . Model Evaluation
Metrics:
RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for regression and forecasting models.
RÂ² Score: To assess how well the model explains the variance in temperature data.
